Introduction
---
Docker containers wrap a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything needed to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries – anything that can be installed on a server. This guarantees that the software will always run the same, regardless of its environment.

We will be using Dockers are lot in this lab so spent some time learning it on the internet.

To do off box programming , you will need to install python, ansible etc on your laptop.  To get you started quickly and to save time, we will use docker to quickly download a pre-installed and pre-configure containers.  

Containers are becoming very popular now, so this will give you some hands on  docker  and how to use it.  Here is a quick comparison between container and hypervisors

Learn more about dockers at https://www.docker.com/


```
Cisco VPN/anyconnect breaks docker communication.  
Make sure you disconnect from anyconnect and use blizzard or wired connection while doing docker exercises.
```
## Docker Toolbox
Docker-toolbox allows you to run docker on your laptop (both in mac or windows).  Follow the link below to install it on your laptop.  Basically it downloads a virtual box boot2docker VM and runs docker engine inside it.  By default this VM is named `default`.  Docker has created `docker-machine` utility to manage docker VM from command line. Basically you can `start / stop / restart` the Docker VM using docker-machine utility.  You can create additional docker machine using the `create` command.  Learn more about it here https://docs.docker.com/machine/

### Exercise-1
#### Installing Docker-Toolbox
1. Download and install docker toolbox. Use all the default settings for the installation.
	https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox

2. This should have install `Docker Quickstart` icon on your desktop.  

** Windows Users, please make sure you install docker toolkit using 'Administrator' account.  Right click on the file and select `Run as Administrator`**

If you have a virtual box installed on your system, please remove it. Let docker tool box install the virutal box for you.

Whenever we say open terminal in this lab guide, please open `Docker Quickstart` on windows.  

**Do not open the command line**

## Docker Machine

When you installed docker tool, `docker-machine` automatically got installed. `docker-machine` utility lets you manage docker engines on different hypervisors including virtualbox. Its like a manager of docker engine. Docker engines can be hosted locally on your virtualbox or remotely on the cloud.

***Make sure you do not have any VPN connections such as Cisco's Anyconnect turned on. This will break the docker functionality***
### Exercise-1
#### Working with Docker Machine Utility

1. Open up Terminal window (windows use open up `gitbash`)
2. Under home directory create a folder and name it `training`
3. cd `~`
4. `mkdir training`
5. `cd training`
4. `docker-machine ls`
![docker1](/images/docker-m-1.png)
3. `docker-machine stop default`
4. `docker-machine rm default`
5. `docker-machine ls`
5. `docker-machine create --driver virtualbox default`
6. `docker-machine ls`  <-- you should see the docker engine running.
5. This should show you all the docker engines that this docker machine is managing.  Your installation of docker toolbox should have created a docker VM named `default` in the Virtualbox.  This a boot2docker VM  that runs the docker engine.  You can use `docker-machine` to manage this docker engine.
6. make sure your running docker Client version 1.12.0 or higher on your laptop.  `docker version`.


### Exercise 2
(Don't do it in the class if you only have 8G RAM)
#### Tune your VM for faster performance
1. Open up virtual box
2. Power off the `default VM`.  Right click and select `power off`.
2. select the `default` VM
3. click on `settings`
4. click on `system` then `Motherboard` , them `processor`
4. increase the memory to `4G and CPU to 4`. (higher the better)
5. do not start the VM yet. we will do it in the next exercise.


### Exercise 3
#### Creating source file.
Source file are used to set the environment variable to communicate to the docker process running install a VM installed in the virtualbox.

1. In the same terminal window
2. type `docker-machine env default`
3. Copy the content to the clipboard.
4. Open the **Atom** Editor.
5. Go to `File` menu and then select `New File`
6. Paste the content in this file.
7. Save the file in the `training` folder as `source.docker`

### Exercise 4
#### Setting the Environment variables using source file
Now, you can use the `source.docker` file to source your environment variables.

1. Switch to your terminal Window.
2. type `source source.docker`  Note: you should be in the training folder to run this command.
2. type `docker ps`
3. This will show you all the containers running on your docker host.  Your docker host name is `default`.  You should not see any containers at this time.  We are going to create containers in the next section (containers).


### Common Docker-machine commands

```
docker-machine status default
docker-machine ip default
docker-machine stop default
docker-machine start default

To recreate the docker vm or to create a new

`docker-machine create --driver virtualbox default`
`docker-machine [stop/start/restart/rm] default`

```


## Extras
**Do not do this in the class**

### Exercise-1
#### Ssh into your Docker VM
You can also ssh into the docker VM. This is not needed for this lab, but just showing you the feature of docker-machine.
`docker-machine ssh  default`
Notice, after you run this command, you will get inside the Docker VM on the Virtual Box.  This VM runs your docker engine. You can run your docker command directly on this VM.  Go ahead and type
```
docker-machine ssh  default
docker ps
Exit
```

`exit` will get back to your Mac Terminal
