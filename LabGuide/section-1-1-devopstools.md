We will try to setup similar environment for you on your laptop. This way we can use these tool for today's lab and then you can have it on your laptop to continue your learning.  Lets install some of the tools:

## GIT
GIT is a very popular and efficient open source Version Control System. It tracks content such as files and directories.

GIT stores the file content in BLOBs (binary large objects). The folders are represented as trees. Each tree contains other trees (subfolders) and BLOBs along with a simple text file which consists of the mode, type, name and SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) of each blob and subtree entry. During repository transfers, even if there are several files with the same content and different names, the GIT software will transfer the BLOB once and then expand it to the different files.

The history of your project is stored in a commit object. Every time you make a modification you have to commit it. The commit file keeps the author, committer, comment and any parent commits that directly precede it.
