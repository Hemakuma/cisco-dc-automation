1.1 Objective

To teach you how to program Nexus switches using varies tools/apps via RESTful API calls.  At the end of the day, each tool changes the managed object stored inside the data model.  In this lab we will be using CLI, REST Client, Python, nxtoolkit and ansible to make configuration changes to the switches.



1.2 Lab Setup

For this lab, we will be using NXOSv virtual switch.  You need to have this virtual switch installed on your laptop.  If you have not already installed it,  see  the prerequisite section above for the details on how to install NXOSv it on your laptop.

For those, who for some reason can not install NXOSv on your laptop, we have installed 20 VM with NXOSv in our lab.  The IPs and hostnames are given below.
